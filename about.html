    <div>
      <p>
        As a software engineer I am a fellow of Pursuit's full stack web development program: A 12-month, Google-funded software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate whose graduates have been hired as developers at leading companies such as Pinterest, JP Morgan, and Spotify.

        I love tech, CES is my Comic-Con from hardware, gadgets and gizmos to software especially Java Script, HTML & CSS.
        
        I'm a great fit for anyone looking for a team player, a tech geek, a food enthusiast, who is up for almost anything. I want to advocacy for community, and equality at companies like Netflix, Google, Apple or Hinge - companies with strong ethics, committed to their employees, community and the environment.
